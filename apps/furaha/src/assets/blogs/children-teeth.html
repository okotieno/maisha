      <strong>When will my child&rsquo;s teeth appear?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      First (or 'baby' or 'milk') teeth usually start to appear when your child is around 6 months old. All 20 baby
      teeth
      should appear by the age of 30 months. For more information, visit

    </p>
    <p>
      The first permanent 'adult' molars (back teeth) will appear at about 6 years, before the first baby teeth start to
      fall out at about 6 to 7. The permanent 'adult' teeth will then replace the 'baby' teeth. It is usually the lower
      front teeth that are lost first, followed by the upper front teeth shortly after. All permanent teeth should be in
      place by the age of 14, except the
      <a href="https://www.dentalhealth.org/wisdom-teeth" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline; color:#123495;">
        'wisdom' teeth
      </a>. These may appear any time between 18 and 25 years of age.

  All children are different and develop at different rates.

<p>
  <strong>Why are baby teeth important if they will eventually fall out?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Baby teeth, or primary teeth, play several crucial roles:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>They help in proper chewing and nutrition</li>
  <li>They aid in speech development</li>
  <li>They guide the permanent teeth into the correct position</li>
  <li>They contribute to a child&rsquo;s self-esteem and confidence by ensuring a proper smile</li>
</ol>

      <strong>How can I prevent cavities in my children&rsquo;s teeth?</strong>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Ensure regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste as soon as the first tooth appears</li>
      <li>Limit sugary snacks and drinks, especially between meals</li>
      <li>Encourage a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
      <li>Regular dental check-ups and professional cleanings where possible</li>

      <strong>How should I clean my child&rsquo;s teeth?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Cleaning your child&rsquo;s teeth should be part of their daily hygiene routine. You may find it easier to stand
      or
      sit behind your child, cradling their chin in your hand so you can reach their top and bottom teeth more easily.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>When the first teeth start to appear, try using a toothbrush designed for children, with a small smear of
        fluoride
        toothpaste.
      </li>
      <li>It is important to supervise your child's brushing until they are at least seven.</li>
      <li>Once all the teeth have appeared, use a toothbrush with a small head and soft bristles in small, circular
        movements and try to concentrate on one section at a time.
      </li>
      <li>Don't forget to brush gently behind the teeth and onto the gums.</li>
      <li>Spit out after brushing and do not rinse so that the fluoride stays on your teeth longer.</li>
      <li>If possible, make brushing a routine - just before your child goes to bed and at least one other time during
        the
        day.
      </li>
      <li>Remember to encourage your child, as praise will often get results!</li>
    </ul>
