    In some parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, people have been using Miswak as an alternative to conventional toothbrushing. The utilization of miswak as an alternative to traditional toothbrushing presents a valuable and culturally embedded solution for maintaining oral hygiene. Miswak, a teeth-cleaning twig derived from Salvadora persica tree, has been recognized for its antimicrobial properties and dental health benefits for centuries. Research indicates that miswak usage effectively reduces plaque, gingivitis, and bacterial growth in the oral cavity.
