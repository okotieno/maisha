    <h1>Oral Health Workshop- Bamako, Mali </h1>
    <p>
      We visited a local school in the Tyenfala Village in Mali, where we educated children aged 3-16 on oral health
      prevention information. We donated toothbrushes and toothpaste, and showed the children how to effectively brush.
      Their teachers were also present and helped facilitate the session. We would also like to thank Dr Mamadou Sylla
      for his support in organizing this health campaign.
