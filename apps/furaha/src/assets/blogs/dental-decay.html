<h1>Dental Decay</h1>
<h2>What is tooth decay (caries)? </h2>

<div class="row g-3 align-items-center">
  <img class="col-lg-4" src="assets/blogs/dental-decay-1.png" alt="">
  <p class="col-lg-8">Tooth decay happens when the two outer layer surfaces of your teeth (enamel and dentine) become softened by acid attack after you have eaten or drunk anything containing sugars. Over time, the acid makes a cavity (hole) in the tooth. Tooth decay is also known as caries. </p>

</div>

<h2>What can I do to prevent tooth decay?</h2>
<h3>Brushing your teeth: </h3>
<p>You should brush your teeth twice a day- at night before you sleep and in the morning. Use a fluoride containing toothpaste. Make sure you brush all surfaces of your teeth. </p>

<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Reduce sugary and acidic foods and drinks. Avoid having snacks between meals. If you are having a sugary snack, try to have it with a meal as opposed to on its own. </p>

<p>If possible, try and see your dentist regularly. Please also try and see a dentist if you experience any pain, sensitivity or issues with your teeth/ mouth. </p>

<h2>How will I know if I have tooth decay? </h2>
<p>It can sometimes be difficult for you to realise you have decay, particularly in the early stages, which is why it is important to see a dentist if you can, as well as maintain good oral hygiene. </p>

<p>Sometimes you may notice holes in your teeth. You may also experience toothache or sensitivity. If you do, please try and see your dentist as soon as possible. In addition to this, you can take painkillers to help with the pain if you are able to. </p>

<h2>What treatment will I need if I have dental decay? </h2>

<p>If the decay is not too deep, the dentist will remove/ clean all the decay and repair the tooth with a filling. Sometimes the nerve in the middle of the tooth can be damaged. If so, the dentist will need to carry out root canal treatment by removing the nerve and then repairing the tooth with a filling or a crown. If the tooth is so badly decayed that it cannot be repaired, the dentist may have to take the tooth out.
