    <h1>Oral Health Workshop - Nairobi, Kenya</h1>
    <p>
      We worked with children aged 4-14, discussing oral health prevention advice. We were also fortunate to have some teachers and parents attending too. This was also an opportunity to showcase some of the digital health topics on our website and gain feedback on how to improve it.
