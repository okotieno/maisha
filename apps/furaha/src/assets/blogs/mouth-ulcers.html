    Oral ulcers, commonly known as canker sores or mouth ulcers, are painful lesions that develop on the mucous
    membranes inside the mouth. These ulcers can occur for various reasons and can significantly impact a person's
    quality of life. Understanding their causes, presentation, symptoms, treatment options, and general advice to
    patients is crucial for effective management.

<h2>Causes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Trauma: Accidental biting, dental procedures, or injury from dental appliances can cause oral ulcers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Immune system dysfunction: Conditions like autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, Crohn's disease) can lead to oral
    ulceration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Infections: viral, bacterial, or fungal infections, such as herpes simplex virus, HIV or candidiasis, can cause oral
    ulcers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nutritional deficiencies: Lack of essential nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, or folate can contribute to oral ulcer
    formation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allergic reactions: Certain foods, medications, or oral care products may trigger oral ulcers in susceptible
    individuals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stress: motional stress or anxiety can sometimes exacerbate or trigger oral ulcer outbreaks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Genetic predisposition: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing recurrent oral ulcers.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Presentation and Symptoms:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Oral ulcers typically present as small, round or oval-shaped lesions with a white or yellowish center and a red
    border.
  </li>
  <li>They can occur on the inner cheeks, lips, tongue, gums, or the roof of the mouth.</li>
  <li>Ulcers may be single or multiple and can vary in size.</li>
  <li>Common symptoms include pain or discomfort, especially while eating, drinking, or talking.</li>
  <li>In severe cases, individuals may experience difficulty in swallowing or speaking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Management/Treatment:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Topical Treatments: Over-the-counter topical gels or ointments containing ingredients like benzocaine, lidocaine,
    or corticosteroids can provide pain relief and promote healing.
  </li>
  <li>Oral Rinses: Mouthwashes containing antimicrobial agents like chlorhexidine or saline solutions can help reduce
    bacterial growth and inflammation.
  </li>
  <li>Pain Management:Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate
    discomfort.
  </li>
  <li>Avoiding Irritants:Patients should avoid spicy, acidic, or rough-textured foods that can further irritate the
    ulcers.
  </li>
  <li>Maintaining Oral Hygiene:Gentle brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush and regular flossing can help prevent
    bacterial buildup around the ulcers.
  </li>
  <li>Dietary Changes:Consuming a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can support oral health and aid in ulcer
    healing.
  </li>
  <li>Stress Management:Stress reduction techniques such as relaxation exercises, meditation, or counseling may help
    minimize ulcer recurrence in stress-triggered cases.
  </li>
  <li>Medical Evaluation: Persistent or recurrent oral ulcers may warrant evaluation by a healthcare professional to
    rule out underlying systemic conditions or infections requiring specific treatment.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>General Advice to Patients:</h2>


<ul>
  <li>Maintain good oral hygiene practices, including regular brushing and flossing.</li>
  <li>Avoid irritating or abrasive foods and beverages.</li>
  <li>Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and gentle brushing technique to prevent further trauma to the oral tissues.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
  <li>Manage stress through relaxation techniques or stress-reducing activities.</li>
  <li>Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as they can exacerbate oral ulceration.</li>
  <li>Consult a healthcare professional if oral ulcers persist, recur frequently, or are associated with other
    concerning symptoms. You can try see a dentist or General Practioner (whichever is easier to access for you in your
    region). It is important to try see a healthcare professional particularly when symptoms are persisting/ worsening.
