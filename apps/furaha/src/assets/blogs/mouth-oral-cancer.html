<h2>Who can be affected by Oral Cancer?</h2>
<p>It is important to note that anyone can be affected by oral (mouth) cancer. However, it is more common in those over 40, particularly in men. Although there are still many cases affecting women and younger people as well. In 2020, there were 377, 713 cases of oral cancer and 177, 757 deaths accounted for globally. </p>

<h2>What are the causes of mouth cancer? </h2>
<p>Many cases of oral cancer can be linked to tobacco and alcohol. In Kenya, cigarette and chewing tobacco are common forms of tobacco. Betel quid or paan can also be particularly dangerous. </p>
<p>Alcohol increases the risk of mouth cancer, and if tobacco and alcohol are taken together the risk is even greater.</p>
<p>Over-exposure to sunlight can also increase the risk of cancer of the lips.</p>
<p>There are also reported links between oral cancer and the human papillomavirus. HPV can be spread through oral sex. Practicing safe sex and limiting number of partners can help reduce this risk. There are also HPV vaccines hat can be given to girls and boys- particularly around the age of 12 or 13, before sexual activity starts. </p>

<h2>What are the signs of mouth cancer? </h2>
<p>Mouth cancer can appear in different forms and can affect all parts of the mouth, tongue, gums and lips. Mouth cancer can appear as a painless mouth ulcer that does not heal normally. A white or red patch in the mouth can also develop into a cancer. Be aware of any unusual lumps in your mouth or jaw area and any persistent hoarseness. It is important to see a dentist or doctor if these areas do not heal within three weeks. If you aren't sure, go for a check-up anyway.</p>

<h2>Is mouth cancer treatable/ curable? </h2>

<p>If mouth cancer is spotted early, the chances of a complete cure are good, and the smaller the area or ulcer the better the chance of a cure. However, too many people come forward too late because they do not have regular mouth examinations. Treatment may include surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy (or combinations of these).</p>
