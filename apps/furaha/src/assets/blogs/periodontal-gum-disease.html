    <strong>What is gum disease?</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Gum disease is described as swelling, soreness or infection of the tissues supporting the teeth. There are two main
    forms of gum disease: gingivitis and periodontal disease.

    <strong>What causes gum disease? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    All gum disease is caused by plaque. Plaque is a film of bacteria which forms on the surface of the teeth every day.
    Many of the bacteria in plaque are completely harmless, but there are some that have been shown to be the main cause
    of gum disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    To prevent and treat gum disease, you need to make sure you remove all the plaque from your teeth every day. This is
    done by brushing and cleaning in between the teeth with ‘interdental' brushes or floss if possible.

    <strong>What is gingivitis? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Gingivitis means ‘inflammation of the gums'. This is when the gums around the teeth become very red and swollen.
    Often the swollen gums bleed when they are brushed during cleaning.

    <strong>What is periodontal disease? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Long-standing gingivitis can turn into periodontal disease. There are a number of types of periodontal disease and
    they all affect the tissues supporting the teeth. As the disease gets worse the bone anchoring the teeth in the jaw
    is lost, making the teeth loose. If this is not treated, the teeth may eventually fall out.

    <strong>Does smoking affect my gums and teeth? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Smoking can also make gum disease worse. People who smoke are more likely to produce bacterial plaque, which leads
    to gum disease. The gums are affected because smoking causes a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream, so the infected
    gums don't heal. Smoking causes people to have more plaque and the gum disease to get worse more quickly than in
    non-smokers. Gum disease is still a major cause of tooth loss in adults.

    <strong>What happens if gum disease is not treated? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, gum disease does not usually cause pain as it gets worse so you do not notice the damage it is doing.
    However, the bacteria are sometimes more active and this makes your gums sore. This can lead to gum abscesses, and
    pus may ooze from around the teeth. Over a number of years, the bone supporting the teeth can become loose or be
    lost. If the disease is left untreated for a long time, treatment can be more difficult.

    <strong>What treatments can be done? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>Prevention is the most important solution. Your dental team can also help remove plaque and tartar form your teeth.
    You will also be shown how to remove plaque successfully yourself, cleaning all the surfaces of your teeth
    thoroughly and effectively. This may take a number of sessions with the dental team. A good oral care routine at
    home with brushing and interdental cleaning is the most important thing you can do to help prevent gum disease
    getting worse.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your gum disease is more severe, your dental team may need to treat the roots of the teeth to make sure that the
    last pockets of bacteria are removed. This is called ‘root planing'. You'll probably need the treatment area to be
    numbed before anything is done. Afterwards, you may feel some discomfort for up to 48 hours.

    <strong>Is gum disease also linked with other health conditions? </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    In recent years gum disease has been linked with general health conditions such as diabetes, strokes, cardiovascular disease, poor pregnancy outcomes and even dementia. More research is needed to understand how these links work but there is more and more evidence that having a healthy mouth and gums can help improve your general health and reduce the costs of medical treatment.
